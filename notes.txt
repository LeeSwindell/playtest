Add start game lobby endpoint
have all players get rerouted to /game/x from /lobby/x
not adding people to lobby group with right group number? seems to be deleted in
start game handler. 


Just remove the lobby/group part of key. use only lobby id to control the
broadcasting. Too much fuss with leaving the lobby group and joining the game
group. anyone in that group will want the update anyways, might as well make it
uniform. 

need to call /leavelobby when navigating away from lobby page. call on dismount

Change structure to include websocket subscription system. Clients connect in the relevant component - lobby/game etc. They subscribe to the lobby id, or lobby list, or game. the backend emits messages to the relevant subscribers. no need for a websocket context and massively scoped state. no need for the backend to remember whos in what lobby.


Use bridge between connection and lobby manager to do the actual function calls.
this should sync actions between the two. joining a lobby will add the right
topic sub, and then use the connection manager to send the new json info out.

Why?
this will decouple the async/sync actions so that all the connection manager
does is sub/unsub, and send messages to actively connected users. then the
disconnect functionality can be synchronous - and we won't unsubscribe users out
of order if the disconnect.
Seems good to have the coupling between lobby+connection managers moved into
their own unit. 

to update:
request lobbies websocket message
unsubscribe lobby list ws msg

adding ws connections and subscriptions to mount/dismount of route components.
